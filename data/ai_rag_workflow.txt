The RAG workflow in Immverse AI includes:
1. Content ingestion and text extraction
2. Chunking into meaningful segments
3. Embedding generation using sentence transformers
4. Storing embeddings in a vector database such as FAISS
5. Retrieving relevant chunks based on user query
6. Passing retrieved chunks to the LLM for answer generation
This improves accuracy and reduces hallucination.
